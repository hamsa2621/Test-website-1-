## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hamsa2621/Test-website-1-/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Test Website 1

Forget the Queens English!

When people skim through a web page it’s much easier for them if you say ‘haven’t or ‘you’re’ instead of ‘have not’ and ‘you are’. Throw away the plum in the mouth and shorten those words.

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Test Header 1
## Test Header 2
### Test Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/hamsa2621/Test-website-1-/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
